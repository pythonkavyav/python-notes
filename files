Files:- 

Files are used to store data it can be used to perform read, write, delete, append etc. 

In python file are written in text/binary format/csv file 

--> file are ending with (\n) or EOL 

-->complexity is less 

File operation:- 

1.open 

2.write 

3.read 

4.tell 

5.seek 

6.close 

Advantage:- 

1.versatality 

2.complexity is less 

3.portability 

Disadvantage:- 

1.error prone 

2.security level 

3.time complexity 

 

Open:- 

To read / write we have to open the file 

---> open() is a built in function 

We have pass path,mode 

os module to get path 

Syntax:- 

File_obj=open('data.txt','w') 

Mode:- 

w---> write the data to file if file already present it will      override the data 

r---> read mode 

w+---> write and read 

r+---> read and write 

a---> append mode (override will not happen) 

a+--->append and read 

 

Write:- 

write is function to write data to file 

Syntax:- 

File_obj.write(content) 

---->write a single string 

----> \n will not provide 

  ----> return None 

writeline()---> write list of string 

    ----> return None 

Close:- 

 

In python automatically file object close 

Syntax:- 

file_obj.close() 

read():- 

Read the content from the file 

Syntax: 

File_obj.read(offset) 

Offset--> bytes of char to read 

readlines()--> read multiple line from file 

tell()-->return file object position 

seek()--> to change file object position 

Syntax:- 

f.tell() 

f.seek(offset,from what) 

From what--> which position 

0 ----> beginning 

1---> current file position 

2---> end of the file 

Offset---> bytes to move forward 

Note:- 

Current /end in seek used only for binary files 

wb 

rb 

 

F1=open('data.txt','wb') 

F1.write(b'hello') 

F1.close()
