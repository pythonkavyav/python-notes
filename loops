Loops: 

Loops is set of instruction/block of code execute repeated/iterate till certain condition satisfy 

Two types: 

1.For loop:- 

Used to repeat a specific block for known number of times. 

2.while loop:- 

Used to repeat a specific block for unknown number of times. 

 

Syntax for Loop:- 

1.to iterate any sequnce[string/list/tuple/dict/set] 

 

for variable_name in sequence : 

         print(variable_name-->current sequence) 

 

Assignment on string: 

1.if string contain digits reverse the word 

Eg: v23be1 vector india 23hn 

1eb32V vector india nh32 

    Count the digits, alphabets and special char in the string 

 

Syntax: 

To iterate the number: 

range()---> built function 

Start with 0 end –1 

 

for var in range(int): 

   Print(var) 

 

While loop:- 

Syntxa: 

Intialize 

Var=0 

While var <10 : 

    Print(var) 

 

Conditional: 

continue—skip the current iteration 

break--->exit the current loop 

pass-->will not do anything(empty block) 

 

else clause(block) with for/while loop: 

If there is break free in loop then else block will execute 

    if break else block will not execute
