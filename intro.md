# python-notes
Why we need learn python: 

1.python is object oriented multi-purpose 

2.easy learn and very less code complexity

    What is python? 

Python is a general-purpose ,high level, object-oriented, 

Interactive, interpreted programming language 

Interpreted:- 

Python use the interpreter to execute the program 

 

How is interpreter works. 

-->line by line 

 

Text editer 

Step-1 

Text editor-->set of instruction is written and saved in .py format/source code 

Step-2 

Sorce code line by line is transfer to complier.complier will check  any syntax error[cpython—c compiler] 

-->convert byte code[low level code] 

Step –3 

Pvm—python virtual machine 

Check any runtime error if anything found gives 

The error message 

It convert byte code into machine code 

Step 4-> 

Output of  the program line by line. 

 

 

 

D/F B/w compiler and interpreter 

Embedded python 

Python Implementation:- 

1.cpython 

2.jpython-->java complier 

3.ironpython--->c# 

4.pypy--->python python compiler 

5.skybison-->c++ 

6.micropython-->microcontroller on pyboard 

7.circuit python 

 

Advantage of python:- 

1.high level language: 

Human readable like english. 

2.Dynamically typed language 

Don't need to mention the data type.dat type will decide at runtime 

Eg:-a=10 

        B='hello' 

3.portable:source code written in one machine[mac] 

You can execute in Linux or windows 

4.interactive and interpreted 

5.easy to write and code complexity is less 

6.Dynamically memory allocation: 

Allocation of memory at runtime[private heap section] 

7.rich in libraries 

 

History of python:- 

Python was invented in the year 1991 feb 

Developed by Guido Van Rossum 

Current version-->3.12.1 

Python3---> 

d/f b/w python3 and  python2 

Input()--->in python 3 

Raw-input--->in python2 

 

Application of python in real time: 

1.spotify 

2.youtube 

3.instagram 

4.Google 

5.mnc company 

6.Gui application 

7.web development 

8.Machine learning and Ai 

9.data science and analyst 

10.chatgpt 

11.facebook 

12.Iot 

 

Install of python 

Linux:-internally python is installed 

Windows.:-python official website 

www.python.org. 

 

Python version--> 

Linux-->python3 –version 

 

What are the ways to work python 

1.interactive mode 

>>> to open  type python3 in linux 

To exit press ctrl + d 

2.script mode 

Vi filename.py ---->write 

Python3 filename.py--->execute 

Note:-semicolon in python for separation not for termination 

Eg:-print(10);print(20);print(30)
