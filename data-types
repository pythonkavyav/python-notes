What is data type: 

Classification / categorization of a data item. 

    Depends on data type interpreter will decide what type of value ,what operation can be performed 

Types: 

1.Numbers:Numeric data type in python are 3 types 

         ---> int 

                     Without decimal point 

                       Eg:- a=10 

                               b=-3 

         --->float 

                     With decimal point

Eg: f=34.5 

F1=-23.4 

                   

         --->complex: 

                 Real and imaginary part 

                   Eg:- c=2+5j 

                            Nu=2j 

2.String: 

Collection of one or more character put in a ' '/ " " / ' ' '   ' ' ' 

*we don't have character data type 

    String length is one then it is one character 

    There is no null 

    String are immutable 

    String can access by using index method. 

    Two ways---> positive[0] negative[-1] 

Immutable: 

We cannot modify the internal state of an object
